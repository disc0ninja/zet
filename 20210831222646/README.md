# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model  
  
Telecom model that "standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system
without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology" Consists of several different layers
that are ech responisble for different and specefic parts of communication.  
  
## The layers of the OSI Model:
1. Physical Layer  
  - Transfer and recieve streams  of raw data over physical network
1. Data Link Layer  
  - *Reliable* transmission of data [frames](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=data%20frames) between two nodes connected by physical layer
1. Network Layer  
  - Addressing, routing, and traffic control management and structuring using [packets](https:github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=packets)
1. Transport Layer  
  - *Reliable* transmission of data [Segements](https:github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=segments) between points on a network.
1. Session Layer  
  - Manages  continuious communication between two nodes.
1. Presentation Layer  
  - Translation of data including [character encoding](https:github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=character%20encoding), compression, and encryption/decryption
1. Applicatoin Layer
