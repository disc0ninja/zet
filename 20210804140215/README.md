[Systemd](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=systemd) Units reside in Unit Files, that define functions managable
by systemd and it's components. Similar to [services](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=services) in other [Init Systems](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=init),
but with much broader range of capabilities.
