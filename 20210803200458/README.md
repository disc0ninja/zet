# audit2allow  
  
generate [SELinux](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=SELinux) policy allow rules from logs of denied operations

pairs well with **audit2why** which translates audit messages into a description of why access was denied

not a *"solve all, be all"* for SELinux problems as it can create security holes
