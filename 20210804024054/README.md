# Containers

Containers are similar to [VM](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=virtual-machine)s but more flexible in many ways. They can provide a light weight and consitent enviornment to run, guest os, services,
or even just a single command or script. The fashion in which containers and container images work, essnetially allows snapshotting for ease of moving system to system or reverting states.
