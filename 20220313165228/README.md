# TCP 3-way handshake  
  
The flow of a 3-way TCP handshake is as follows:  
1. SYN - A SYN packet is sent from the requestor  
1. ACK/SYN - The reciever replies with an ACK/SYN back  
1. ACK - The requestor sends a final ACK  
  
at this point the 3 way handshake is complete and data can start flowing between the 
two endpoints.
