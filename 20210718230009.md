# Zettlekasten

    Note taking technique created by Niklas Luhman that uses UUID's
    and short but concise and potentially inter-interlinking, but
    not dependant content.

    In order to maintain the integrity of each **zettle** references
    to a zettle search are safer than direct references to zettles.

    *e.g* <https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=zettlekasten>
