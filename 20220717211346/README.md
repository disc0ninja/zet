# Pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit hooks are essentially commands or scripts that are configured to run prior to a [git](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=git) commit being processed and can be used to do things like
additional linting, adding functionality, triggering pipelines, etc.

Example: Adding a pre-commit hook to this [zet](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=zet) repo to update partially typed query links with the full url to save time and keystrokes making notes.
