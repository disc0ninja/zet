# Virtual Machines (VM)s

Similar to [containers](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=containers), but instead of sharing the host [kernel](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=kernel) they require entire operating systems to be installed and all necassary hardware to be virtualized, running on a [hypervisor](https://github.com/disc0ninja/zet/search?q=hypervisor)
Generally speaking they are not as light weight or effecient as containers, but they can be more capable if hardware level or different kernels are a requirement.
